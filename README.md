Open Source CDN jsDelivr
========

[www.jsdelivr.com][1]

Similar to Google Hosted Libraries jsDelivr is an Open Source CDN that allows developers to host their own projects 
and anyone to link to our hosted files in their websites. 

We offer a stable CDN that can be used in production even on popular websites with huge amounts of traffic.
There are no bandwidth limits or premium features and its completely free to use by anybody.

All kinds of files are allowed, including javascript libraries, jQuery plugins, CSS frameworks, fonts and more.

You can use this repo to make your own modifications and improve the contents of jsDelivr's CDN.
Feel free to open issues and pull requests if you think something should be added/removed/modified.

All changes made to this repo are synced to the CDN.
It can take a few minutes for the changes to appear on the website.

[How jsDelivr works - What makes it special][4]


How to submit or update projects:
---------------------------------

 1. Fork the jsDelivr repository.
 2. Locally make the changes you want to be synced with the CDN
 3. Send the Pull request with a description of the changes you made following the same structure as the rest of the projects in the repo.
 4. Wait for the approval.
 5. Thats it


Auto-Updating
-------------

[Coming soon](https://github.com/jsdelivr/libgrabber)

    
File Structure
--------------
Under `files/` a directory for each project is created. Please follow the instructions bellow.

1. Lowercase
2. No special characters or spaces. Allowed: . - _
3. Only the name of the project
4. If the project is a plugin of a library append the name of the library. ex: `jquery.blurjs`, `bootstrap.select`

In some cases a few exceptions can be made.


A project's directory should contain the following:

1. `info.ini` containing all needed information. [Example][2]
2. Directories named after the version of each project. 
* The version directories can contain in their names numbers, letters and -,_ symbols.
3. Do not create `latest` version directories. They are automatically created on our side.

A version directory should contain the following:

1. Static files needed for the project to work. 
2. If there is no minified version of the main js/css file please create your own. [Tool][3] (Minify only, no symbol obfuscation. )
3. Do not upload useless files like demos, examples, licenses, readmes and any other files not being used in the production.


URL Structure
-------------

`//cdn.jsdelivr.net/{projectName}/{version}/{file}`

`//cdn.jsdelivr.net/{projectName}/{version}/{projectName}.zip`

`//cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/{projectName},{projectName},{projectName}`

`//cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/{projectName}@{version},{projectName}@versionAlias,{projectName}`


Version aliasing
-------------

For latest version use:

`//cdn.jsdelivr.net/{projectName}/latest/{file}`

You can also load latest versions per branch:

`//cdn.jsdelivr.net/{projectName}/3.8/{file}` Latest in 3.8 branch

`//cdn.jsdelivr.net/{projectName}/3/{file}` Latest in 3 branch

To automatically load the main file of a project use:

`//cdn.jsdelivr.net/{projectName}/{version}/mainfile`

Depending on project it will automatically load the main file as configured in `info.ini` with correct MIME HTTP headers. If no `mainfile` parameter was specified the url will result in 404 error.


Load multiple files with single HTTP request
--------------------------------------------

Loads mainfile latest version. Only for Javascript!

`//cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/abaaso,ace,alloyui`

Loads mainfile latest version for all files and for abaaso loads version 3.8.15

`//cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/abaaso@3.8.15,ace,alloyui`

Loads mainfile latest version for all files and for abaaso loads version branch 3.8. In this case = 3.8.16

`//cdn.jsdelivr.net/g/abaaso@3.8,ace,alloyui`


First 3-4 requests will be slow because they are not cached. After the first 4 requests these dynamic files get cached and become static files same as all others.

Custom CDN Hosting
---

If your project does not qualify to be hosted in Github or for any reasons you need direct access to your files then its not a problem.
We can offer SFTP access to origin restricted to a single directory managed by the author.
This way you will have full control over your files without any of the restrictions of Github and still be able to utilize the full power of jsDelivr.

This kind of custom hosting can be suitable for:

* Binary hosting. Windows executable files and zips.
* Frequently updated files.
* Projects that can't follow jsDelivr file structure.
* Other...

Simply send an email to [jimaek](https://github.com/jimaek) with more information.

jsDelivr is here to help and not to limit. Even if what you need is not listed above feel free to contact us.



Contribute Performance Data
---

**jsDelivr** uses real user performance data also known as RUM to make its routing decisions. This data is gathered from hundreds of websites and is used in our load balancing algorithm to make accurate decisions based on real time performance metrics.

This is why we offer the ability to all users to help us out. This data is very important and we encourage all users to participate.

All you have to do is include the following JavaScript code in your website before `</body>`.
This code is then executed each time a user visits your website. It uses his browser to test the latency to our CDN providers and gather performance and availability metrics on each one of them.

These benchmarks are completely transparent to the user and do not impact on browsing in any way. We store the following information:

* Performance metrics to each of our providers.
* Availability metrics to each of our providers.
* Browser’s User-Agent
* First three octets of the user’s IP address 

Our JS code is executed with a 2 seconds delay and tests all of our providers unless interrupted. This testing does not impact on your website performance or user browsing experience.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
(function(w, d) { var a = function() { var a = d.createElement('script'); a.type = 'text/javascript';
a.async = 'async'; a.src = '//' + ((w.location.protocol === 'https:') ? 's3.amazonaws.com/cdx-radar/' :
'radar.cedexis.com/') + '01-11475-radar10.min.js'; d.body.appendChild(a); };
if (w.addEventListener) { w.addEventListener('load', a, false); }
else if (w.attachEvent) { w.attachEvent('onload', a); }
}(window, document));
</script>
```
